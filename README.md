# GitHub Copilot Metrics Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a web-based dashboard designed to visualize GitHub Copilot metrics for organizations. It provides insights into usage statistics, such as acceptance rates, suggestion counts, and user activity, helping organizations monitor and evaluate their adoption of GitHub Copilot. The dashboard features interactive charts and sortable tables to present the data in an accessible and actionable format.

The codebase is heavily inspired by the [GitHub Copilot Metrics Viewer](https://github.com/github-copilot-resources/copilot-metrics-viewer) repository, adapting its concepts to create a tailored solution for organizational needs.

> **Note**: Approximately 95% of the code in this project was generated by Grok, an AI assistant created by xAI. The primary focus was on functionality rather than code quality or optimization. This project serves as a proof-of-concept and may require refinement for production use.

## Features

- **Overview Dashboard**: Displays key metrics such as acceptance rates (by count and lines), total suggestions, lines suggested, and the number of languages used over the last 28 days. Includes pie charts for top 10 languages by acceptance and line charts for trends over time.
- **Data Table**: A sortable and filterable table showing daily metrics by language, including active users, suggestions, acceptances, and lines of code.
- **User Activity**: Tracks assigned seats, no-show seats (assigned but never used), and seats with no activity in the last 7 days, with a sortable table of user details.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Powered by ApexCharts for dynamic and responsive charts.

## Prerequisites

- **Java**: JDK 17 or higher (Spring Boot dependency).
- **Maven**: For building and managing dependencies.
- **GitHub API Access**: Requires a GitHub token with appropriate permissions to fetch Copilot metrics.
